mesh collider: 
if we have defined object for example box or rectangle etc then
we use box collider. but if we have irrregular shape for example terrain then we 
will use mesh collider


RigidBody isKinematic:

When isKinematic is set to true, the RigidBody will not respond to for
ces and collisions in the same way as non-kinematic RigidBodies.
 You have to manually control its position and rotation through scripting. 
This is useful for objects that you want to move programmatically without 
being influenced by external forces.

When isKinematic is set to false, the RigidBody responds to forces and collisions
as expected in a physics simulation. Gravity, applied forces,
and collisions will affect the object's motion.

useGravity:
 Determines whether the object is affected by gravity.
isKinematic: 
Determines whether the object responds to physics forces
or is controlled programmatically.


getComponent:

public GameObject cude;
public Rigidbody rd;
void Start()
{
    rd = cude.GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
    rd.useGravity = true;
    
}

Discrete Collision Detection:

Methodology: In discrete collision detection, collision checks 
are performed at discrete points in time,
 usually at each frame of the simulation or at fixed intervals.

Continuous Collision Detection:

Methodology: Continuous collision detection involves checking for
 collisions continuously over a range of time rather than at specific 
time points. It is used to detect collisions that might be missed by 
discrete methods due to objects moving too fast between frames.


public void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)
{
    if (collision.gameObject.name.StartsWith("otherCube")) {
        print("collision is detected");
	destroy(transform.gameObject)
    }
}
public void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
{
    if (other.gameObject.name.StartsWith("Ground") || other.gameObject.name.StartsWith("otherCube")) {
        print("triggered");
	destroy(other.gameObject);
    	
    }
}



Note:
We can apply trigger enter on single object and whether is trigger is
on in gameOvject with which script is attacjed or other game object 
it should be on on either game Object and it will work

for 3D gameObject:

transform.Translate(0,0,0);
transform.position = new vector3(0,0,0);
transform.rotation = quaterion.Euler(new vector3(0,0,0));

for 2D gameObject:

transform.Translate(0,0,0);
transform.position = new vector2(0,0);
transform.rotation = quaterion.Euler(new vector2(0,0));
transform.rotation = quaterion.Euler(0,0,0);

Sprite Renderer:

In Unity, the SpriteRenderer is a component specifically designed for rendering 2D sprites. 
It's commonly used in 2D games and applications to display images, 
characters, backgrounds, and other 2D graphics. 
Here's an explanation of the key features and usage of the SpriteRenderer 

Spehere collider:
Mosty  used with cylinderical shapes
Suitable for GameObjects with round or spherical shapes, such as balls, coins, or other objects where a spherical collision boundary is appropriate.
Versatility:
Provides a versatile representation for objects with a rounded or curved form, allowing 
for more natural interactions in certain scenarios.

keycode:

if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.K)) { 
	do something    
}
if (Input.GetKeyUp(KeyCode.K)) { 
	do something    
}


AudioSource:

 public AudioSource re;
 re = cude.GetComponent<AudioSource>();
if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.V)) {
    re.Play();

}


3D Animation:

charcter inspector => rig =>Animation Type => humaniod =>Apply
after doing this
take charcter in to your scene
add animator component to character if not attached already
then go to create option create animator controller 
now drop this animator in animator controller option
now we can add as many animation to controller as we want and create different 
parameters to handle our animations

Now in order to handle animation in scrits create animatorobject in script
public animator an;;
an = getComponenet<Animator>();
an.SetBool("isWalking", false);
downlaod animations from any platform like mixamo.com
and use these in animator controller


gameObject.isActive("false");


pausing and resume the game
==========================

using UnityEngine;

public class GameController : MonoBehaviour
{
    private bool isPaused = false;
    public GameObject pauseMenu;

    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Escape))
        {
            if (isPaused)
                ResumeGame();
            else
                PauseGame();
        }
    }

    void PauseGame()
    {
        isPaused = true;
        Time.timeScale = 0f; // Pause the game
        pauseMenu.SetActive(true); // Show the pause menu
    }

    void ResumeGame()
    {
        isPaused = false;
        Time.timeScale = 1f; // Resume the game
        pauseMenu.SetActive(false); // Hide the pause menu
    }
}

difference between prefab and gameObject:
============================================

if we edit ine prefab and override it and apply it willmakes changes to all the prefabs
in game scene that is advantage of prefab.



   On MouseDown()--> through this method you can directly click on the gameobject
    OnTouchStart()--> replacement of OnMouseDown for touch input
    Difference between OnMouseDown() and GetMouseDown()
    OnMouseDown() is only workable with colliders on the gameobject


rayCasting
=========
public GameObject fpsCam;
Public float range = 500;

public void shoot(){
	Raycast hit;
	if(physics.Raycast(fpsCam.transform.position),fpsCam.transform.forward,out hit,range){
		if(hit.transform.tag == "enemy"){
			enemyMovement enemy = hit.transform.getComponent<enemyMovement>();
			enemy.die();
		}
	}
}



Initilizing Array in C#
=============================
 array = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };


prefab :
=========

make  change in one prefab and ot can be used or reverted to all other in the scene

override => revert all


unity bool and isTrigger parametrs
===============
animator.SetBool("IsWalking", true);

trigger:
===========
Trigger parameters are similar to bool parameters but are designed for one-shot events or transitions.
Once a trigger is set to true, it remains true until the next frame, after which it automatically resets
 to false. This makes triggers useful for events that should happen only once.

animator.SetTrigger("AttackTrigger");

transform.Translate(Vector2.up * 250 * Time.fixedDeltaTime);
